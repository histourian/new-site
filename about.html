			This project began as an effort at public history, with the aim of encouraging locals and tourists alike to engage with the history of place on an intellectual level beyond what is so often provided by sightseeing routines. By modifying the model of a free walking tour, Histourian strives to provide more robust historical context and offer space for more independent contemplation. The idea is that these tours can be a reference for  spontaneous, meandering, and inquisitive walks around town. Too often, local history is reduced to architectural greatest hits, mythologized tales, and ancestral investigation. Here, I seek to add depth to these qualities which make local history unique—and demonstrate their interconnection and consequence—by contextualizing local events within broader historical narratives.

			While this project has been a solo endeavor, I owe a great debt to the resources of local public libraries as well as the historic Redwood Athenaeum, for their access to quality sources outside of the academic setting. I always welcome thoughts and feedback on any of my work. You can reach me at lucyhknox [at] gmail.com.

				<h2>What Histourian says:</h2>
			
				<p>“At a time when many residents of American border territories turned west to realize their ambitions of conquest and prosperity, for New Englanders the sea was in some ways a suitable substitute for the frontier.”</p>
				<p>“To most colonial Newporters, it was more important that their town be competitive in commerce than it be pure in religion.”</p>
				<p>“The rising temperance movement of the early nineteenth century was motivated by a combination of righteousness drawn from the nation’s founders, sentimentalism of the Romantic era, and moralistic fervor of the Second Great Awakening.”</p>

				<h2>What other walking tours say:</h2>
				<p>	“The [local high school] is one of only three public schools built of marble in the United States.”</p>
				<p>“[Local resident] was the cashier of the [local bank] and later served as Treasurer of [different local bank].”</p>
				<p>“Note the tin roof on this and the adjoining house. The story goes that a tin roof salesman lived [in this neighborhood] and convinced several of his neighbors to install them.”</p>
